# Data Science Internship Projects

Welcome to the repository for my data science internship projects at Cognorise Infotech. This repository contains code for three projects: Credit Card Fraud Detection, Titanic Survival Prediction, and Fake News Prediction. Each project aims to solve a specific problem using machine learning techniques.

## Projects Overview

### Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The code includes preprocessing steps, handling class imbalance, model training, and evaluation using techniques like SMOTE and RandomUnderSampler.

### Titanic Survival Prediction

The Titanic Survival Prediction project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using various machine learning algorithms. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.

### Fake News Prediction

In this project, we develop machine learning models to identify fake news articles. The code includes loading and preprocessing the dataset, conducting EDA, training multiple classifiers, and evaluating model performance using various metrics.

## Usage

To use the code:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-science-internship.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory of interest (e.g., `credit-card-fraud-detection`, `titanic-survival-prediction`, `fake-news-prediction`).

3. Follow the instructions provided in the respective README files within each project directory to execute the code and analyze the results.
